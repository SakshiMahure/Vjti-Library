      <h5 class="card-title col-8 mt-4"> HISTORY</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text col-8 mt-4">Established in 1887 (VJTI Memorandum of Association),
        VJTI started with two departments, namely the Sir J. J. School of Mechanical Engineering and the Ripon Textile
        School for the two branches of industry to meet the technical manpower requirements of Bombay and arou

        The first step in the expansion of the Institute was taken in 1903 when courses in Electrical Engineering were
        introduced.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text col-8 mt-4"> The Technical & Applied Chemistry Department was
        added in 1906, followed by the Department of Sanitary Engineering in 1913. By G. R. No. 1850 of 27th June 1913,
        the institute was recognized as the Central Technological Institute of Bombay Province. In the early days, the
        Institute was housed in Byculla in a building donated for the purpose by Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit.</p>

        <div style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text mt-4">
          Soon after the First World War in 1923, the Institute moved to its present campus at Matunga. Besides Sir
          Petit, contribution of the liberal grants came from the Government and the Bombay Mill Owners' Association. A
          new block of northern light roof type construction was added in 1931 for housing the textile machinery and
          equipment which was obtained through the kind offices of Sir Ness Wadia.

          <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-4">The Bachelor Degree courses in Textile, Mechanical Engineering
            and Electrical Engineering were started In 1946,1947 and 1949 respectively. Victoria Jubilee Technical
            Institute has played a very vital role in setting up IITs during 1955-60. Prof. Kelkar, founder director of
            IIT Kanpur and planning officer of IIT Bombay was VJTI Electrical Engineering faculty. Prof SenGupto,
            founder director of IIT Madras was Principal of VJTI.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The Institute has been affiliated to the University of Bombay and was one of
            the fourteen institutes selected by the Central Government for further development with grant-in-aid from
            Govt. of India. Prior to 1960 Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute was the only Institute offering
            Engineering degree and Post Graduate courses under the University of Bombay and enjoyed de facto autonomy.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1997, the Institute was renamed from its old name Victoria Jubilee
            Technical Institute to its present name Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute.</p>

        As you will agree:<br>
        <em>â€œEngineering is the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences, gained by study, experience and practice, is applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize economically the materials and forces of nature for the benefit of mankind.â€œ</em>
        <br>
        The engineer, like the scientist should have the ability to acquire and subsequently apply information. It is necessary for him to be aware of current progress in his own field.
