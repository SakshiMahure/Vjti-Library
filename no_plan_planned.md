 Want access to our library? Then here's a convenient way to do so... Our website allows students to access the library just sitting at their place.  
<br><br>
   
 <----SECTIONS--->
      
-  1. Student Section:-<br>
      The student section is where a new student can register when he/she enters VJTI. After a student is registered he/she can simply login next time. We have a very secured validation system which only allows students with VJTI e-mail IDs to register as well as login. 
 <br>
     The <i>key features</i>:
      <ul>
        <li> All books: Students can see all the books available in library. They can even search for a book.
          <li> Issue book:If the desired book is found student can issue it and then the book belongs to him for a particular period of time. Student cannot issue more than a particular number of books at a time.
            <li> Waiting list: Supposing the book that the student is looking for is not available, then the user can add his name to the waiting list. He/she can also see the number of people already present in the waiting list for that book. If he/she is the first person in the waiting list, once the book is returned back to library, they receive a mail and only they can issue that book.
            <li>While going through the books if you find an important one and don't want to forget it then don't worry, you can simply add it to your wishlist.
            <li>Request book: If the book your searching for is not present in the library then you can request it, or if some one has already requested it you can simply like it and show your interest.
            <li>Book Bank: Books from the book bank can also be viewed and issued by students.
      </ul>
      
    

             
- 2. Admin Section:-<br>
